## Features
There are 4 main features in my app Heelios:

3. Favoriting products, adding items to cart from the favorites tab
4. Creating, editing, and deleting reviews

### Carts
The carts features was incredibly fun for me to make. Primarily because I personally love shopping so being able to dive deep into this feature and really understand what happens when I add a product to cart in a different website was incredibly eye-opening. Some of the challenges I faced with creating carts were that updating items in the cart weren't updating in real time.
