## Features
There are 4 main features in my app Heelios:
1. Account creation and log in
2. Adding items to the bag, removing items from the bag, and editing items that are in the bag
3. Creating, editing, and deleting reviews
4. Favoriting products, adding items to cart from the favorites tab

### Account Creation/Log In

The carts features was incredibly fun for me to make. Primarily because I personally love shopping so being able to dive deep into this feature and really understand what happens when I add a product to cart in a different website was incredibly eye-opening. Some of the challenges I faced with creating carts were that updating items in the cart weren't updating in real time.
